# Obstrukt Online

An ongoing effort to implement Obstrukt, an online multi-player turn-based board game heavily inspired Quoridor, as well as AI opponents for single-player sessions.

### Progress

The game currently supports local online multiplayer, i.e., it runs on an npm server, allowing two players to play in separate tabs on the same network or machine. This setup is a temporary solution to simulate online gameplay for development and testing purposes. Local gameplay is also supported, where users can play in a single browser window.


### Features In development: 
Full real-time multiplayer support using a backend server, enabling players to connect from different devices.

Integration of AI opponents in both local and online play.

History navigation, allowing players to step through their games both during and after game termination.

Game analysis using a game engine, allowing players to evaluate board positions and study past games.
